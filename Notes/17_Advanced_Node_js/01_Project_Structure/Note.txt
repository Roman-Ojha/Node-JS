    -> Purpose of controller is to receive the request and sending the response only, it's purpose is not to handle the business logic
    -> Controller can only be use for validation
    -> Controller forward the request to 'Service' for business logic and Service will directly not access the database rather it will access the 'Model' layer
    -> now this 'Model' layer will have simple query attach to it which will going to do query to the database
